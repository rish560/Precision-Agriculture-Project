## 1. Rishav Choudhary

### Project Overview

The goal of this section is to define the core product vision, backend structure, and the UI flow for the Precision Agriculture Platform.

**Project Name:** Precision Agriculture Platform

**Tech Stack:** React, Spring Boot, MySQL

**Target Users:** Farmers, farm managers, and administrators

### Problem Statement

Farmers face unpredictable crop yields and waste resources because they lack real-time visibility into soil and field metrics.

### Proposed Solution

A centralized full-stack web application that allows users to manage farms, track crop health data, and automate scheduling.

The system is designed to keep farm data organized, improve monitoring, and give users a simple dashboard for day-to-day farm operations.

### Database Schema (MySQL)

**User**: `id` (PK), `username`, `password`, `role` (Admin / Farm Manager / Guest), `dob`

**Farm**: `id` (PK), `farm_name`, `geo_location`, `owner_id` (FK to User)

**Crop**: `id` (PK), `crop_name`, `farm_id` (FK to Farm), `status` (Growing / Harvested)

### Backend REST APIs (Spring Boot CRUD)

**Farm Management**: `POST` (Create Farm), `GET` (Fetch All / Specific), `PUT` (Update Details), `DELETE` (Remove Farm)

**Crop Management**: `POST` (Add Crop to Farm), `GET` (View Farm's Crops), `PUT` (Log Growth Status), `DELETE` (Remove Crop)

### Frontend Screens (React)

1. **Login Page** - Restricts dashboard views based on user permissions (`Admin` vs. `Guest`).
2. **Farms Dashboard** - Grid view showing all registered farms and their locations.
3. **Management Modals** - Forms to quickly add user, add farm, and add crop data.

### System Architecture

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```


### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Database Setup - Sprint 1**
   Build local MySQL tables and create Java JPA entity mappings for User, Farm, and Crop.
2. **REST Controllers - Sprint 2**
   Write Spring Boot service classes and test CRUD endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) via Postman.
3. **React UI Assembly - Sprint 3**
   Build the frontend dashboards and use Axios / Fetch to pull data from backend APIs.
4. **Role Lock & Testing - Sprint 4**
   Add role restrictions, execute end-to-end testing, and prepare the final pull request.

### Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Precision Agriculture Platform
- **Tech Stack:** React, Spring Boot, MySQL

### Problem Statement

Farmers find it difficult to keep track of their farms and crops using paper records. This can lead to mistakes and make it harder to manage farming activities.

### Proposed Solution

Create a website where users can easily manage farms, crop details, and other farming information in one place.

### Data to be Stored

- **User:** Stores user details such as name, login information, date of birth, and role (Admin, Farm Manager, or Guest).
- **Farm:** Stores farm details such as farm name, location, and owner information.
- **Crop:** Stores crop details such as crop name, the farm where it is grown, and its current status (Growing or Harvested).

### Backend Functions

- **User Management:** Register users, log in, and view user details.
- **Farm Management:** Add a new farm, view farms, update farm details, and remove a farm.
- **Crop Management:** Add a crop, view crop details, update crop status, and remove a crop.

### Frontend Screens

- **Login Page:** Users enter their username and password to access the system.
- **Dashboard:** Displays all farms and crop information in one place.
- **Management Forms:** Simple forms that allow users to add, update, or delete farms and crop details.

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Planning and Database**
	Understand the project requirements and create a database to store user, farm, and crop information.
2. **Backend Development**
	Develop the main functions that handle user, farm, and crop information and make sure they work correctly.
3. **Frontend Development**
	Build the website pages and connect them with the backend so users can interact with the system.
4. **Testing and Final Submission**
	Test all features, fix any problems, ensure everything works properly, and submit the completed project.

### Project Overview

- **Project Name:** FarmVerse – Precision Agriculture Platform
- **Tech Stack:** React, Spring Boot, MySQL

### Problem Statement

1. Farmers face difficulties in managing multiple farms efficiently.
2. Manual farm management is time-consuming and prone to human errors.
3. Poor monitoring and resource management can reduce crop yield and productivity.
4. Existing manual systems are not scalable and lack real-time monitoring capabilities for modern agricultural operations.

### Proposed Solution

1. Develop a web-based application for efficient farm management.
2. Provide modules for Farm, Crop, and User Management.
3. Provide an interactive dashboard with automated monitoring and reporting features to support better decision-making.
4. Design a scalable system that can support future growth and additional features.

### System Architecture

2. **Farms:** id, farmName, location, ownerId (Foreign Key)
3. **Crops:** id, cropName, cropType, farmId (Foreign Key), status (Growing / Harvested)

These tables are connected through relationships to maintain organized and consistent data.

### Backend

The backend will be developed using Spring Boot and will provide RESTful APIs for managing the system.

#### Backend Features

1. User CRUD APIs
2. Farm CRUD APIs
3. Crop CRUD APIs
4. User Registration & Login
5. JWT-based Authentication & Authorization

### Frontend

The frontend will be developed as a web application using React and will provide a user-friendly interface for managing farms, crops, and users.

#### Frontend Pages

1. Login Page
2. Register Page
3. Dashboard
4. Users Management Page
5. Farms Management Page
